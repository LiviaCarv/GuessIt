# Guess It App

Guess It is a word guessing app developed as the fourth project during the "Developing Android Apps with Kotlin" course at Udacity.
In this project, architecture for app development was studied, utilizing UIController, ViewModel, and LiveData.
By implementing this architecture, we achieved a clean separation of concerns, making our app more maintainable, testable, and scalable. 
Additionally, it allowed for better code organization and improved the overall development experience.

## Overview

You can play it solo or with friends by holding the device in landscape mode, facing away from you, with your thumbs on the Skip and Got It buttons. Your friends can then provide clues to help you guess the word.
If you correctly guess the word, press the "Got It" button. If you're stuck, press "Skip." The game runs for one minute and then displays your score.
